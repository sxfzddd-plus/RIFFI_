The Python scripts in this repository contain the code used to produce the experimental results presented in the paper:
“Regional Isolation Forest: A Novel Approach for Enhanced Anomaly Detection and Interpretability.”

Repository Structure
-models → This folder contains the Python scripts that implement the models proposed in the paper, including the Regional Isolation Forest (RIF) and its feature importance method, RIFFI.

-utils → This folder includes utility scripts that define helper functions used within the model classes.

-performance → This folder provides testing scripts for evaluating the proposed methods.

-RIF_demo.py is the anomaly detection test script, which includes experiments on three synthetic datasets and public UCL datasets as used in the paper.

-RIFFI_demo.py is the interpretability test script, offering test examples on UCL datasets.
